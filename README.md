# DETECTION OF CYCLONES AND HURRICANES
The detection of cyclones and hurricanes will be based on the meteorology satellite images database.These public databases contain free images of metreological data which will then be fed to a Convolutional Neural network which is created using TensorFlow libraries,A free API available on the tensorflow website which will be used as a classifier for the test image.

The steps for the Project,
1.Traning the API based inception model with the meterological database images.

2.Setting catrgories of classification as image with potential of causing a hurricane as that can be easily done due to the labled database of past hurricanes.

3.Feeding the real time sattelite images to model and testing results.

This method is based on the accurate feature extraction and detection of the CNN used hence could be used to detect the potential(future) cyclones and hurricanes from the real time images(currently available).

Before the formation of the cyclone or hurricane the wind patterns and cloud formation in image would assume specific features and as we feed the successive real time data of images so that in each succession the predection accuracy is further imporved finaly leading to accurate conclusion.
